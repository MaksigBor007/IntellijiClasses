                                 Types of Variables in Java:
    There are 3 types of variable 1) local 2) instance 3) static

    1) Local variable :

    if a variable is inside a method || a part of its parameters || or a loop || switch statement ||
    if else condition, it is called a local variable.

    2) Instance variable:

       If a variable is inside the class but outside of any block of code like method loop
       switch statement if else condition it is called an instance variable.

    3)static variable:

    If an instance variable has a static keyword with it than it is called a static variable

Why learn about different types of variable:
    1)  it helps us reduce the amount of RAM
        that our application will be using
        when it will be running.

    2)  We can pass information between methods of class with the help of these variables.

    3)  They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time of time as soon as your method is done
        executing they are destroyed by a special program called garbage collector


                                How to use these:
    Local: Create inside block of code

Advantages vs Disadvantages

                                Local variables
advantages:     They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time
                Always try to use local variables when possible to save memory

disadvantages:  They are very limited in scope means we can't access them outside of method or the block
                of scope.

                               Instance variables:
Advantages:     They have broader scope as compared to local variables means we can access
                in all the methods of the class.

Disadvantages:  They occupy the space in your RAm for longer periods of time.

                               Static variables:
Advantages:     We can call static variables without creating an object of a class.
                We can share a single value between all the objects of a class
