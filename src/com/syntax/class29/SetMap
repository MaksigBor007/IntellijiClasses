Set :
    Set in java does not allow duplicate values. There are many types of sets but we
    will only discuss the most widely used ones which are
    1)HashSet 2)LinkedHashset 3) TreeSet
HashSet:
    Upside: Most commonly used type of set it is fastest when it comes to insert and
    retrieve the data.
    Downside: Insertion order is not maintained.
    No get method to get a single value.
LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: Insertion order is maintained.
    Downside: insertion speed is comparable to HashSet but the retrieval speed is the
    slowest.
TreeSet:
    Upside: The Data is stored in the  sorted (ascending order)form.
    Downside: Insertion speed is slow. Retrieval speed is better than linkedHashSet
    but slower than Hashset.
Note:
Mostly used to remove duplicates.
=============================================================
Map:
    Allow to store key value pairs. first Entry is treated as key and the second one is
    treated as value. Keys can't be duplicate but values can be.
    Map<Integer,String> items=new HashMap<>();
    There are many types of Maps as sets but we will only discuss 3 of them.
    1) HashMap 2) LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap
HashMap:
    it is fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the data.
    Downside: Insertion order is not maintained.

LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: Insertion order is maintained.
    Downside: insertion speed slower than HashMap Retrieval speed is slowest of all.
TreeMap:
    Upside: data is stored in sorted form always.
    Downside: insertion speed is very slow.
Choose proper DataStructure.
    Q1:I want to store unique names in the sorted form.
    A: TreeSet
    Q2: I want to store the names of the students and most of the time i will be
    performing operation related to data retrieval based on index.
    ArrayList
    HashTable:
    Its old and slow but provides thread safaty
    Important notes:
    We can use three method to get a data from the map
    1)EntrySet:key,value store inside an object of type Map.Entry
    we can use getKey method on this object
    to get key of that entry and getValue() method to get the value of that entry.
    2)KeySet():it will return all the Keys from a map in the form of set.
    3)value():it will return all the values from a map in the form of collection.

    FileHandling in JAVA:
    We need to have below three things in order to read/write a file Manually.
    1) Path of the file that we want to read/write
    2) We need to navigate to that file
    3) We need to have software installed  on your PC to interact with that file.

    We need to have below three things in order to read/write a file Manually.
    1) Path of a file we can store inside a String
    2) We can use the FileInputStream/FileOututStream class to navigate to that forlder
    3) We can use specific java file
