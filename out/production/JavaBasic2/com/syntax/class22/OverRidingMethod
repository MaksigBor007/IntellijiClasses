 1) Method names should be same but parameters should be different.
    2) we can't overload a method by just changing its return type.
    3) We can also overload constructors by following the same rules.
=========================================================================
what is MethodOverriding:
    Happens when same method exists inside the parent class and the child class.
Why we should override a method:
    If we are inheriting from a Parent class and we don't like the implementation
    of a method from the parent class we can provide our own implementation.
    Sometimes it's done to improve the performance of code.
How we can override a method:
    when we inherit from a class we just need to rewrite that method inside the
    child class. all should be same except the body and access modifiers.
Rules:
    1) for Override we must inherit from a class.
    2) The method in the parent class that we want to override must be exactly the same
    as method in the child class only the access modifiers can be different
    3) The access modifiers in the Child class can only be increased with respect to the
    visibility for example we can change default to protected or to public but we can't make
    it private.
    4) if something is not inherited we can't override it for example private methods and
    constructors.
