 When we have a parent and a child class and one or may intermediate classes we call
    it multilevel inheritance.

Hierarchical inheritance:
    when we have a single Parent class and multiple direct child classes it is called
    Hierarchical.
======================================
Super Keyword:
    Super is a keyword that we use to refer to the parent class fields methods or constructors.
Why should we use super keyword:
    1) if we have same name fields inside the parent class and child class we can use the super keyword.
    to distinguish these fields. It's not that common
    2) we can use the super() to call the constructor of the parent class as they are not inherited.
    3) If we have same name methods inside the parent and the child class we can use super keyword
    to call the method from the parent class.

=======================================
Method Overloading:
    whenever same name method exists in a class with different parameters we call it method
    overloading.

Why we should use MethodOverloading:
    it helps us write cleaner and more readable code and also provides the flexibility to have
    same name methods in a class.
How to create an overloaded method:
    create same method name but make sure this differs in the number of parameters or in types of
    parameters or in sequence of parameters.

Rules:
    1)Method name should be same but parameters should be different.
    2)By just changing the return type we can't overload a method.
    3)We can't overload by just changing the access modifiers(private,default,protected,public)
     and non-access modifiers(final static and abstract).
    4)We can also overload constructor in the same manner as we do for methods.
